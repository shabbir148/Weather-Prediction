# Weather-Prediction
Climate change has been at the top of our minds and at the forefront of important political decision-making for many years. Shallow clouds play a huge role in determining the Earth's climate. Theyâ€™re also difficult to understand and to represent in climate models. There are many ways in which clouds can organize, but the boundaries between different forms of organization are murky. This makes it challenging to build traditional rule-based algorithms to separate cloud features. We will build a model to classify cloud organization patterns from satellite images. If successful, we'll help scientists to better understand how clouds will shape our future climate.
